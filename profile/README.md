## BRG code repositories

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
-->

This organization contains all public repositories of the Block Research Group at ETH Zurch.
Most of these repositories contain COMPAS packages with code corresponding to the work of BRG's past and present researchers.

To get started with COMPAS, check out the [COMPAS framework website](https://compas.dev),
and the main [COMPAS documentation pages](https://compas.dev/compas).

To try out the functionality of some of the packages directly in the browser, without installing anything,
have a look at [brg-jupyterlite](https://blockresearchgroup.github.io/brg-jupyterlite/lab/index.html).

We are committed to making our work available to the community, in academic and in professional practice.
If you encounter something that doesn't work, please let us know via the issue trackers of the corresponding repository,
so we can make it better.

Enjoy!
BRG
